# Tarot-Divination
This is a text based card game modeled after a black jack game. It reads data from a .txt file that has information about the cards and their meanings. It draws three cards at random and assigns a Major Arcana card to each. There is a menu option that allows you to view information about the cards and game after taking user input to start the simulation.
